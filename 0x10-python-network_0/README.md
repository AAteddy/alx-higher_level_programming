<h1>Python-Network#0</h1>
In this networking project, I used curl in Bash scripts to send various types of HTTP headers. In the process, I learned about how URL's work, domain names, the many different HTTP request/repsonse header fields and status codes, and how to utilize cookies.
The concepts I have learned and practiced from this project are:
<li>
1. What a URL is
2. What HTTP is
3. How to read a URL
4. The scheme for a HTTP URL

13. What an HTTP request method is
14. What an HTTP response status code is
